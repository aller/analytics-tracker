> <strong>Analytics Tracker on GitHub</strong><br>
> You can submit feature requests or bugs on [Analytics Tracker](https://github.com/valeriu/analytics-tracker) repository.


== Installation ==
In most cases you can install automatically from WordPress.org.

However, if you install this manually, follow these steps:
1. Create the directory \'auto-update\' in your \'/wp-content/plugins/\' directory
2. Upload all the plugin\'s file to the newly created directory
3. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress

If you don't have an Google Analytics ID, you need to go to [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics), create an account and [get the code](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1032385?rd=1), similar to UA-XXXXXXX-YY

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I suggest a new feature, contribute or report a bug? =
You can submit pull requests, feature requests and bug reports on [our GitHub repository](https://github.com/valeriu/analytics-tracker).

= What are the requirements to use this plugin? =
You need an active Google Analytics account and obviously a WordPress blog.

= Where can I see the analytics report? =
You can see your detailed analytics report in your [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics) account.

= What data does the tracking snippet capture? =

When you add either of these tracking snippets to your website, you send a pageview for each page your users visit. Google Analytics processes this data and can infer a great deal of information including:

* The total time a user spends on your site.
* The time a user spends on each page and in what order those pages were visited.
* What internal links were clicked (based on the URL of the next pageview).

In addition, the IP address, user agent string, and initial page inspection analytics.js does when creating a new tracker is used to determine things like the following:

* The geographic location of the user.
* What browser and operating system are being used.
* Screen size and whether Flash or Java is installed.
* The referring site.
